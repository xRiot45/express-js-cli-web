# GitIgnore Configuration

The `.gitignore` file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from being included in the repository.

## Ignored Files and Directories

### Compiled Output

These directories store compiled or built files, which are not necessary for version control.

```gitignore
/dist
/node_modules
/build
```

### Logs

Log files are automatically generated by applications and should not be committed.

```gitignore
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
lerna-debug.log*
```

### Operating System Files

Certain files are generated by operating systems and should be ignored.

```gitignore
.DS_Store
```

### Test Coverage Reports

These files are generated when running test coverage tools and should not be committed.

```gitignore
/coverage
/.nyc_output
```

### IDE and Editor Configuration Files

Each developer may use different IDEs, so personal workspace settings should not be included.

```gitignore
/.idea
.project
.classpath
.c9/
*.launch
.settings/
*.sublime-workspace
```

### Visual Studio Code Settings

VS Code settings are generally ignored, except for important shared configurations.

```gitignore
.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
!.vscode/extensions.json
```

### Environment Variable Files

Environment variables often contain sensitive information, so they should not be tracked.

```gitignore
.env
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
.env.local
```

### Temporary Files

Temporary files and directories should not be committed.

```gitignore
.temp
.tmp
```

### Runtime Data

These files store process IDs and runtime data, which should not be versioned.

```gitignore
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock
```

## Notes

- Excluding these files helps keep the repository clean and secure.
- If certain files need to be committed despite being in `.gitignore`, use `git add -f <file>`.
- Ensure sensitive data like API keys are never committed by using `.env` files properly.

This `.gitignore` file is optimized for Node.js projects, but you can modify it based on your project's needs.
