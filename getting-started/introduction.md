<!-- ### üöÄ Introduction -->

**Express JS CLI** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to make it easier and faster to create **RESTful API** projects using **Express JS framework**. With this CLI, developers can immediately create a neat project structure, install the necessary dependencies, and configure various key features according to user preferences without having to do time-consuming manual setup.

Express JS CLI comes as a solution for developers who want to save time in the initialization stage of backend projects using Express.js. With support for programming language selection (JavaScript or TypeScript), database configuration (MySQL or PostgreSQL), as well as tools such as Prettier for code formatting and Husky & Commitlint for commit standardization, this CLI is designed so that developers can focus directly on developing business features without worrying about the initial technical setup.

This tool is perfect for beginners, development teams, freelancers & startups who want to start projects quickly as well as for development teams who want to maintain standards and consistency in their projects. With just a few simple commands, Express.js projects are ready to go with a structure that conforms to best practices.

### ‚ùì Reasons Why Express JS CLI was Created?

When starting a new **Express.js** project, developers often face challenges such as :

- Repetitive setup of project structure.
- Manual installation of dependencies.
- Time-consuming configuration.
- Lack of standardization across projects.
- Difficulty in setting up best practices from the beginning.
- Inconsistent code formatting and commit conventions.
- Complexity in integrating database support.

**Express JS CLI** solves these issues by automating the initialization process, ensuring a **standardized and efficient** project setup so developers can **focus on building business logic** rather than handling boilerplate code.
