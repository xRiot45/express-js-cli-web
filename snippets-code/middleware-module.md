# Middleware Module

## Description

The middleware module is responsible for processing HTTP requests before they reach the main application logic. Middleware functions can be used for logging, authentication, validation, error handling, and modifying request/response objects.

## Code Implementation

Below is the implementation of the middleware code.

### JavaScript Version

```javascript
const testMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Implement your middleware logic here
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};

export default testMiddleware;
```

### TypeScript Version

```javascript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

const testMiddleware = (
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction,
): void => {
  try {
    // Implement your middleware logic here
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};

export default testMiddleware;
```

## Explanation

### Key Features

1. **`next()` Function** → Passes control to the next middleware in the request-response cycle.
2. **Error Handling (`next(error)`)** → Ensures any errors are properly passed to the Express error-handling middleware.
3. **Request Processing** → Middleware can modify the request (`req`) or response (`res`) before passing it further.

### How It Works

- The **JavaScript version** defines a simple middleware function without type safety.
- The **TypeScript version** ensures type safety by enforcing `Request`, `Response`, and `NextFunction` types from Express.
- If an error occurs inside the middleware, it is passed to the error-handling middleware using `next(error)`.

## How to Use

### Importing the Middleware Module

```javascript
import testMiddleware from "../middlewares/test.middleware.js";
```

### Applying Middleware in an Express Application

```javascript
import express from "express";
import testMiddleware from "./middlewares/test.middleware.js";

const app = express();

app.use(testMiddleware);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Middleware is working!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

Middleware functions are crucial in Express applications for processing requests before they reach controllers. TypeScript enhances middleware with type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability. Using **`next()`**, middleware can properly manage request flow and handle errors effectively.
