# Util Module

## Description

The utility module provides reusable helper functions that can be used across the application. These utility functions help in reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

---

## Code Implementation

Below is the implementation of the utility code.

### JavaScript Version

```javascript
const testUtil = () => {
  // Implement your util logic here
};

export default testUtil;
```

### TypeScript Version

```javascript
const testUtil = (): void => {
  // Implement your util logic here
};

export default testUtil;
```

## Explanation

### Key Features

1. **Reusability** → Utility functions can be used throughout the application to avoid redundant code.
2. **Modularity** → Helps in organizing and structuring reusable functions separately.
3. **Type Safety in TypeScript** → The TypeScript version enforces type definitions for better code safety.

### How It Works

- The **JavaScript version** defines a simple function that can perform any reusable logic.
- The **TypeScript version** ensures type safety by specifying the return type.
- The module can contain multiple utility functions based on the application's needs.

## How to Use

### Importing the Utility Module

```javascript
import testUtil from "../utils/test.util.js";
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
const result = testUtil();
console.log("Utility function result:", result);
```

## Conclusion

Utility modules help in maintaining cleaner code by encapsulating commonly used functions in one place. TypeScript provides an additional benefit of type safety, ensuring better reliability and maintainability.
